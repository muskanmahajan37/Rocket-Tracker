# OpenCV-Yolov3-CPU

## Description

 A setup to run open cv with yolov3 on CPU.

## Features

- Basic setup to see how opencv deep neural network works in practice

## How to use

- `git clone <repository url`
- `cd <repository>`
- download weights and configuration file from [here](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
- download coco.names from [here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names)
- run the main notebook using jupiter notebook
- Give input/objects when prompt opens.
- Custom folder name is supported, may have to change script a little
- Wait for pictres to get displayed

## Contribute

Feel free to fork it and create your own versions. Make sure you have installed all the dependencies

## Getting Started

simply clone the repository to acquire the dataset.
